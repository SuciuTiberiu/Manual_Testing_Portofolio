# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

API Documentation: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/

**The final project will be split into 2 sections: [Testing section](https://github.com/SuciuTiberiu/Manual_Testing_Portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](https://github.com/SuciuTiberiu/Manual_Testing_Portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#2-sql-section).**

Tools used:

# Functional specifications

-> enter here the functional specifications created in JIRA


# 1 Testing section

## 1.1 Test Planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Recruitment\Vacancies module from the OrangeHRM application. 

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

#### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated
   
   - Project manager - Mihai Popescu
   - Product owner - Ioana Crisan
   - Software developer - Catalin Chitu
   - QA Engineer - Viorel-Tiberiu Suciu

#### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined

   - functional specifications are defined
   - roles needed for the project are allocated
   - initial project risks were detected and mitigated
   - test environment, test data and test tool are set

#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined

   - number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or they have low priority
   - all tests have been executed
   - all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team
   - deadline was reached
   - exploratory regression testing must be performed on the Recruitment module, which includes the Vacancies section

#### 1.1.4 Test scope

* __Tests in scope:__ All the feature of Vacancies module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing, GUI testing and API testing
* __Tests not in scope:__ Performance testing, integrations of the Recruitment module with other modules, compatibility testing with multiple browsers

#### 1.1.5 Risks detected

* Project risks: lack of experience of the QA team, short deadline of Zephyr Squad trial, unavailability of test environment, disappearing of the section
* Product risks: validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end-user

#### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue. 

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

Variou periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken. The following status report was generated after 50% of the test cases were executed, on 18/05/2022:

## 1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases 
are:
